## Aircrack-ng

**Aircrack-ng** is a powerful tool designed for network security testing, capable of cracking WEP and WPA/WPA2 networks that use pre-shared keys or PMKID. Aircrack-ng is an offline attack tool, as it works with captured packets and doesn't require direct interaction with any Wi-Fi device.

Prior to commencing passphrase cracking with Aircrack-ng, it is imperative to assess the benchmark of the host system to ensure its capability to execute brute-force attacks effectively.

### ðŸ“Œ Syntax
```bash
##aircrack-ng -S
```

| Command                                           | Description         |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `aircrack-ng -S`                                  | Benchmark system    |
| `aircrack-ng -K <file.ivs>`                       | Crack WEP           |
| `aircrack-ng <file.cap> -w /opt/wordlist.txt`     | Crack WPA           |

## Airdecap-ng

**Airdecap-ng** is a valuable tool for decrypting wireless capture files once the key to a network has been obtained.  
It supports decrypting **WEP**, **WPA PSK**, and **WPA2 PSK** captures. It can also remove wireless headers from unencrypted capture files.

This tool is particularly useful for analyzing captured packets by making their contents readable and stripping out unnecessary wireless protocol information.

### ðŸ”§ Use Cases

- Removing wireless headers from an open network capture (unencrypted capture)
- Decrypting a WEP-encrypted capture file using a hexadecimal WEP key
- Decrypting a WPA/WPA2-encrypted capture file using the passphrase

### ðŸ“Œ Syntax

```bash
airdecap-ng [options] <pcap file>
