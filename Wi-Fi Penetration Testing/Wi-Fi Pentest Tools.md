## Aircrack-ng

**Aircrack-ng** is a powerful tool designed for network security testing, capable of cracking WEP and WPA/WPA2 networks that use pre-shared keys or PMKID. Aircrack-ng is an offline attack tool, as it works with captured packets and doesn't require direct interaction with any Wi-Fi device.

Prior to commencing passphrase cracking with Aircrack-ng, it is imperative to assess the benchmark of the host system to ensure its capability to execute brute-force attacks effectively.

### ðŸ“Œ Syntax
```bash
##aircrack-ng -S
```

| Command                                           | Description         |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `aircrack-ng -S`                                  | Benchmark system    |
| `aircrack-ng -K <file.ivs>`                       | Crack WEP           |
| `aircrack-ng <file.cap> -w /opt/wordlist.txt`     | Crack WPA           |

## Airdecap-ng

**Airdecap-ng** is a valuable tool for decrypting wireless capture files once the key to a network has been obtained.  
It supports decrypting **WEP**, **WPA PSK**, and **WPA2 PSK** captures. It can also remove wireless headers from unencrypted capture files.

This tool is particularly useful for analyzing captured packets by making their contents readable and stripping out unnecessary wireless protocol information.

### ðŸ”§ Use Cases

- Removing wireless headers from an open network capture (unencrypted capture)
- Decrypting a WEP-encrypted capture file using a hexadecimal WEP key
- Decrypting a WPA/WPA2-encrypted capture file using the passphrase

### ðŸ“Œ Syntax

```bash
airdecap-ng [options] <pcap file>
```
## Aireplay-ng

**Aireplay-ng** is primarily used to generate traffic for later use with Aircrack-ng to crack WEP and WPA-PSK keys. It supports different types of attacks such as deauthentication, fake authentications, interactive packet replay, hand-crafted ARP request injection, and ARP-request reinjection. With the `packetforge-ng` tool, it is also possible to create arbitrary frames.

### Features of Aireplay-ng

Run the command:

```bash
aireplay-ng
```
| Attack | Attack Name                    |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| 0      | Deauthentication              |
| 1      | Fake authentication           |
| 2      | Interactive packet replay     |
| 3      | ARP request replay attack     |
| 4      | KoreK chopchop attack         |
| 5      | Fragmentation attack          |
| 6      | Cafe-latte attack             |
| 7      | Client-oriented fragmentation |
| 8      | WPA Migration Mode            |
| 9      | Injection test                |

## Packet Injection Check

Before sending deauthentication frames, verify if your wireless card supports packet injection by pinging the Access Point (AP).

### Enable monitor mode:

```bash
airmon-ng start wlan0 1
```
## Set to a specific channel (example: channel 1):
```bash
sudo iw dev wlanmon0 set channel 1
```
## Test packet injection:
```bash
sudo aireplay-ng --test wlan0mon
```
## Deauthentication Attack
Use airodump-ng to view available networks:
```bash
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon
```
## Send deauthentication frames:
```bash
sudo aireplay-ng -0 5 -a <BSSID> -c <Station> wlan0mon
```
