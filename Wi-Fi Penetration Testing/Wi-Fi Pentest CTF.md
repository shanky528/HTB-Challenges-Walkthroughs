## 🔐 WiFi Network Connection CTF

This document outlines two hands-on challenges focused on connecting to WPA and WEP wireless networks via the Linux command line. You'll learn how to configure, authenticate, and retrieve flags from a simulated access point—essential skills in WiFi penetration testing and network security assessments.

---

## 🧰 Tools Required

`wpa_supplicant` – for authenticating to WiFi networks via CLI
- `dhclient` – for obtaining an IP from DHCP
- `curl` or `ping` – for verifying connectivity and capturing flags
- `ifconfig` – for checking IP address assignment

---

## 🌐 Methods to Connect to WiFi

You can connect to wireless networks using:
- **GUI**: Clickable interface (NetworkManager)
- **CLI**: Preferred for scripting, automation, and headless environments

This guide focuses on **CLI-based connection**.

## 🔑 Connecting to WPA/WPA2 Network (Challenge 1)

### 🎯 Objective:
Connect to a WPA2 WiFi network and retrieve the flag hosted at a given IP address.

### 🛰️ Target Network Details:
- **SSID**: `CyberNet-Secure`
- **PSK**: `Password123!!!!!!`
- **Flag Location**: `http://192.168.1.1`

### 📝 Steps:

1. **Create a WPA configuration file:**

Using `nano` or any text editor:
```bash
nano wpa.conf
Add the following:
network={
    ssid="CyberNet-Secure"
    psk="Password123!!!!!!"
}
```
Save with Ctrl+O and exit with Ctrl+X.

Connect to the WiFi network using wpa_supplicant:
sudo wpa_supplicant -c wpa.conf -i wlan0
-c: Specifies the config file
-i: Interface (replace with yours, e.g., wlan0)

Leave this terminal running or run in background using &.Obtain an IP address from the DHCP server:

sudo dhclient wlan0 -r     # Release existing lease (optional)
sudo dhclient wlan0        # Request a new lease

Verify your IP address:
ifconfig wlan0
Ensure an IP in the 192.168.1.x range is assigned.

Capture the flag:
ping 192.168.1.1           # Confirm connectivity
curl http://192.168.1.1    # Retrieve the flag
✅ Flag obtained!

🔑 Connecting to WEP Network (Challenge 2)
🎯 Objective:
Connect to a WEP-secured WiFi network and retrieve the flag.

🛰️ Target Network Details:
SSID: HackTheBox-WEP

WEP Key: 1A2B3C4D5E

Flag Location: http://192.168.2.1

📝 Steps:
Create a WEP configuration file:
nano wep.conf
Add:
```bash
network={
    ssid="HackTheBox-WEP"
    key_mgmt=NONE
    wep_key0=1A2B3C4D5E
    wep_tx_keyidx=0
}
```
Save and exit.

Connect to the WEP network:
sudo wpa_supplicant -c wep.conf -i wlan0

Request IP from DHCP:
sudo dhclient wlan0 -r     # (Optional: clear previous lease)
sudo dhclient wlan0

Confirm IP assignment:
ifconfig wlan0

Capture the flag:
ping 192.168.2.1
curl http://192.168.2.1
✅ Flag obtained!

📌 Notes
Replace wlan0 with your wireless interface name. Use iwconfig to list interfaces.

If wpa_supplicant is stuck, run it in the background or open a new terminal to continue.

Use killall wpa_supplicant to terminate any existing sessions before retrying.

WEP is deprecated and insecure. Use this only in labs or simulations.
