## 📶 WiFi Security Protocols Overview

| Protocol | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **WEP**  | Outdated and insecure. Uses weak encryption. Easily cracked. |
| **WPA**  | Improved over WEP with TKIP. Still vulnerable. |
| **WPA2** | Strong AES encryption. Standard for many years. |
| **WPA3** | Most secure, uses individualized encryption and modern protocols. |

## 🔍 Key Components of a WiFi Pentest

1. **🔑 Passphrase Assessment**  
   Test the strength of WiFi passwords using:
   - Dictionary attacks
   - Brute force
   - Cracking tools like `aircrack-ng`

2. **⚙️ Configuration Analysis**  
   Analyze access point settings, encryption protocols, and network segmentation.

3. **🏗️ Infrastructure Testing**  
   Probe the network’s architecture, firmware versions, and AP security posture.

4. **📱 Client Testing**  
   Identify vulnerabilities in connected devices (e.g., drivers, OS, network stack).
